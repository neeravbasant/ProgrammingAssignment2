## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object 
## that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
## which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(solve) i <<- solve
  getinv <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see 
## if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse 
## from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates 
## the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via 
## the setinv function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(i)
  i
}
